# Basic-Python-Projects

Python Basic Projects
This repository contains beginner-friendly and intermediate-level Python projects, perfect for practicing programming skills or learning Python basics. Each project is designed to be simple yet insightful, covering various Python concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and basic file handling.

Project Structure
The projects are divided into two levels: Beginner and Intermediate. Each project is self-contained and has clear instructions for use.

Level 1: Beginner-Friendly Projects
Number Guessing Game

Description: A game where the computer generates a random number, and the user guesses until they find the correct answer. Feedback like "too high" or "too low" helps guide the player.
Concepts Used: Random number generation, loops, conditionals.
Simple Calculator

Description: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers provided by the user.
Concepts Used: Functions, user input, mathematical operations.
Temperature Converter

Description: Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on user input.
Concepts Used: Input validation, basic mathematical formulas, conditionals.
Mad Libs Generator

Description: A fun program where users input words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), which are then integrated into a pre-defined story template.
Concepts Used: String manipulation, user input, formatting.
Basic Text-Based Adventure Game

Description: Creates a simple interactive story where the player makes decisions that affect the outcome.
Concepts Used: Conditional statements, user input, storytelling.
Level 2: Intermediate Projects
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Description: The classic game against a computer AI. The winner is determined based on game rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock).
Concepts Used: Randomization, conditionals, loops.
Basic Quiz Game

Description: A multiple-choice quiz that evaluates the user's knowledge and calculates their score.
Concepts Used: Lists, dictionaries, loops, conditionals.
Password Generator

Description: Generates secure passwords of user-specified lengths, with options for including special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
Concepts Used: Randomization, string manipulation.
Simple Text Analyzer

Description: Analyzes a given text to count words, characters, sentences, and calculate the average word length.
Concepts Used: String processing, loops, basic statistics.
Basic To-Do List App

Description: A simple text-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
Concepts Used: Lists, input/output, conditionals.
